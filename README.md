Hello! My name is Ace, and I’m the creator of this Repo. I started school in the fall of 2023, and am set to graduate in the spring of 2025! I have a passion for educating, so I’m very lucky to have the opportunities I do at school. Through hard work and determination I’ve overcome adversities centered around my health, and I wake up every day ready for the chance to change the world, hopefully through offering the chance for someone to learn programming.

Initially called “playground,” this was where I tested small things or set up projects that eventually fell through. It was, however, also the place I started keeping my LiveCodes that I’ve done as a Student Tutor! I take pride in my livecodes not being too serious, instead leaning towards engagement, hence the pop culture references and the nods to the audience in my notes. My notation in these files is the most meticulous I have been with any of my projects, specifically to benefit those who come across them.

There’s multiple things that I left out of both live codes, for the sake of not handing the students all of the answers. As the curriculum has changed, I’ve considered revisiting and updating them to include such things. I also would like to add more live codes to these, I think they’re a great way for me to keep sharp on my skills. The hardest part of all of them is figuring how much detail to include, and how in depth I should be with these concepts.

Creating a Robot Army in C! (Singly Linked Lists):
This was a fun livecode I did for the new students learning C. Starting with the header file, we can see a simple function list. There’s a struct for our robots, and three following functions. One to add a robot to the beginning of the list, one to add a robot to the back of the list, and one to print the reports for the robots. Each of these functions exist in their own file in the directory. One of the things I didn’t include for the students was the function for freeing a node in a linked list, it was cut primarily for time but also so the students didn’t have the entirety of their assignment handed to them. There’s a small typo left in the Robot Report from when I was running it live on stage. The students were keen on pointing out syntax errors as I programmed, but left the typo in the print statement for me to discover later in the live code. It was an endearing moment, so I’ve left it there for memory’s sake.

PrintF:
This is a livecode that happened later in the trimester for the new students. As there’s a lot of moving parts on this one and it’s a more serious project, I didn’t add too much flair other than a cheeky joke on the students. The assignment is to recreate the PrintF function in C from scratch, using only a handful of the lowest level commands C has to offer. By this point I had the smart idea to set aside the actual code in a different directory, and have the skeleton code front facing. This way if someone wanted to try coding it themselves they could! I broke PrintF into three parts, the part that tokenizes input, the part that searches for the correlating function within the command, and the functions that fully print out the characters.
